title: Tiling Window Managers Ruined Floating for Me

I used to think tiling window managers were for hardcore keyboard elitists who wore out their Caps Lock keys remapping it to Escape. Then I tried one — and now I can't go back.

## First Contact: i3

It started with `i3`. I followed a YouTube guide, copied someone’s config, and spent an hour figuring out why my terminal wouldn’t launch. But once it clicked, it *clicked*.

No overlapping windows. No dragging with the mouse. Just clean, efficient layouts and full control from the keyboard.

## The Hidden Benefits

What surprised me wasn’t just the speed — it was the **mental clarity**. With a tiling setup:

- Every window has a place.
- I stop alt-tabbing and start focusing.
- Multitasking feels intentional, not chaotic.

## What I Use Now

I’ve since moved to `sway` on Wayland, but the principles remain:

- **Mod+Enter**: Launch terminal  
- **Mod+D**: App launcher  
- **Mod+H/J/K/L**: Move focus  
- **Mod+Shift+H/J/K/L**: Move windows  

No mouse. No distractions. Just work.

## Floating Feels Wrong Now

Whenever I use a traditional desktop, I find myself **annoyed**. Resizing windows with the mouse? Painful. Stacking apps manually? Inefficient. The floating paradigm now feels outdated.

## TL;DR

Tiling window managers aren’t just for neckbeards and minimalists. They’re productivity tools — and once you get used to them, it’s hard to imagine using anything else.

*Try one. Your workflow will thank you.*
