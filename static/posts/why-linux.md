title: Why I Switched to a Minimalist Linux Setup

For years, I chased the perfect desktop environment — the flashiest icons, smoothest animations, and most customizable panels. I hopped from GNOME to KDE, from XFCE to Budgie, and even toyed with window managers like i3 and Awesome.

Eventually, I realized something: I was spending more time tweaking than actually *using* my system.

## The Turning Point

One day, my system froze mid-update — again. Frustrated, I wiped everything and installed Arch with nothing but `zsh`, `tmux`, and `neovim`. No display manager, no fancy themes, just raw productivity tools.

To my surprise, I felt *free*.

## What I Use Now

Here’s my current setup:

- **OS**: Arch Linux (btw)
- **Window Manager**: `sway` (Wayland i3 clone)
- **Terminal**: `foot`
- **Shell**: `zsh` with minimal plugins
- **Editor**: `neovim` with `telescope`, `lspconfig`, and `cmp`
- **Browser**: `qutebrowser` + `Firefox`

## Why It Works for Me

- **Speed**: Boot time is under 5 seconds.
- **Focus**: No distractions, no popup notifications.
- **Customizability**: I tweak only when I *want* to, not because the UI invites me to.
- **Simplicity**: Every tool I use does one thing well.

## Final Thoughts

Minimalism isn't for everyone. But if you're feeling bogged down by bloat, or distracted by customization rabbit holes, give a minimal setup a shot. You might be surprised how much more you get done.

*Less really is more.*
